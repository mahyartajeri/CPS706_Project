                                    all the edges in the network in relation to the starting node, and iterates through the lists

                                <p>Dijkstra's Algorithm is a centralized Link-State algorithm used to find the path of shortest
                                    cost between two nodes and is widely used for network routing. It works by retreiving all
                                    the costs between the nodes on the network, putting them in lists and iteratively sorting and 
                                    selecting the smallest cost that is connected to each node starting from the edges connected to
                                    the starting node and continuing from there. The algorithm updates a forwarding table, keeping
                                    a record of and printing the nodes previously used and the costs of the paths to connect them 
                                    as it iterates closer to the last node. The table will be populated in order of nodes visited from
                                    the first node to the last node and will be the most cost-efficient path possible.

                                <p>The step-by-step process goes as follows:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Initialize the lists containing all the edges and the nodes connected to them, set the
                                                forwarding table distance from the starting node to 0, and set the rest to infinity for now.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Iterate through, identify and select the least cost path connected to the starting node and 
                                                add that value to the distance from the starting node. Mark down the node that the edge 
                                                connects to as visited.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Repeat the step above for the edges connecting to the last visited node and compare the nodes
                                                next to it. If a more cost-efficient path presents itself, the algorithm 
                                                would back-track and redefine itself on that new path.   
                                        </li>
                                        <li>This algorithm repeats the steps above until reaching the destination node, returning the final

                                <h3 id="initiating">Bellman-Ford Algorithm</h3>
                                <p>The Bellman-Ford Algorithm is a decentralized algorithm used to find the path of shortest
                                    cost between two nodes and is another type of algorithm used for network routing. It works by
                                    storing edge relations to each node, putting them in lists. Starting from the identified start
                                    node, the nodes communicate with each other, passing information about what the costs of its edges
                                    are and where they connect and through an iterative process coordinate the most cost-efficient 
                                    path to the destination node. This algorithm also follows the same forwarding table rules as
                                    Dijkstra, marking down the nodes and costs associated as it routes from start to finish. Unlike Dijkstra,
                                    no back-tracking is done and in addition since Bellman-Ford follows a decentralized model it can handle
                                    negative edge costs as well. However, for the purpose of network routing there will not be any 
                                    contexts that involve a negative edge cost.
